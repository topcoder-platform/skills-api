    API for consolidated skills services to be presented to the various presentation and analysis layers of the platform.


    **PAGINATION**
      Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can specify further pages with the `page` parameter. You can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `perPage` parameter.


      Pagination response data is included in http headers. By Default, the response header contains links with `next`, `last`, `first`, `prev` resource links.

      **Point to note** - the page attributes will have no effect if the data is fetched from db and not from es.
